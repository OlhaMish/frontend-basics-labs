    <p>Berlin is the capital and largest city of Germany, both by area and by population. 
        Its more than 3.85 million inhabitants make it the European Union's most populous city, 
        as measured by population within city limits. The city is also one of the states of Germany, 
        and is the third smallest state in the country in terms of area. Berlin is surrounded by the state of Brandenburg, 
        and Brandenburg's capital Potsdam is nearby. The urban area of Berlin has a population of over 4.5 million and is 
        therefore the most populous urban area in Germany.</p>
